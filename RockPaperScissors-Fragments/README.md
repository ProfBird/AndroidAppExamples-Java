This app  demonstrates using Fragments. There are two activities and two fragments. On a device with a:
  * small screen - the first activity loads the first fragment, and the second activity loads the second fragment
  * large screen
     * portrait orientation: the first activity loads fragment 1 on top and fragment 2 at the bottom
     * landscape orientation: the first activity loads fragment 1 on the left and fragment 2 on the right.

Note: This app is just one app in the class demo repository. To get the source code for this app you will need to clone or download the whole repository, https://github.com/ProfBird/AndroidAppExamples-Java/.
